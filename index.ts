so all who chose could ride away from the scenes of destruction and desolationbecause of government and financial interests of the time the official san francisco death toll has always been extolled

abdominal pain and 50 of those with abdominal pain vomit many children can be diagnosed with either cvs or abdominal migraine when both symptoms occur the authors use the predominant or most consistent symptom as the primary labelmedical care pharmacologic therapy is used to prevent episodes of vomiting or to decrease their frequency other medications may be used to abort or attenuate episodes once they begin preventive medications are normally used in patients with more than a single episode of cyclic vomiting syndrome cvs per month the mainstays of prophylactic therapy include cyproheptadine amitriptyline propranolol phenobarbital and erythromycin when prophylactic agents fail or episodes occur infrequently abortive agents such as ondansetron and sumatriptan may be used if abortive therapy fails supportive combinations such as ondansetron plus lorazepam or chlorpromazine plus diphenhydramine may attenuate an attack of cyclic vomiting in progressin the absence of known pathophysiology treatment of cvs remains empiric li and fleisher 1999 forbes 1995 the following 5 management strategies are used for cvs avoidance of triggers prophylactic pharmacotherapy abortive therapy supportive care during acute episodes and family support li and balint 2000in some instances avoiding identified dietary triggers such as chocolate cheese and msg can prevent episodes without the use of medication li and balint 2000 if psychological stressors trigger episodes stress management techniques or benzodiazepine anxiolytics lorazepam or diazepam may help to abort attacks in the early stages however avoiding common triggers such as car rides and infection may be impractical or impossible interestingly a 70 decrease in frequency of episodes placebo effect upon consultation and lifestyle changes without drug therapy has been noted fleisher 1995daily prophylactic pharmacotherapy may be used to prevent episodes that occur more than once per month or if they are extremely severe and disabling eg lasting 3 d li 1993 li 1996 most of these drugs are nongi medications such as antimigraine agents anticonvulsants neuroleptics and prokinetic drugs a family history positive for migraines predicts a high response rate 80 to antimigraine medications therefore these agents are a logical first choice li and balint 2000in an openlabel experience with efficacy defined as greater than 50 reduction in episode frequency or severity propranolol cyproheptadine and amitriptyline were effective 57 39 and 67 of the time respectively li and hayes unpublished data 1999 pfau 1996 andersen 1997 the north american society for pediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutrition guidelines recommend cyproheptadine as firstline therapy in children younger than 5 years however cyproheptadine can cause substantial weight gain because of an increase in appetite amitriptyline is the firstline choice in children older than 5 years and adolescents li and balint 2000 phenobarbital demonstrated a 79 success rate in one openlabel trial in children who did not have eeg changes gokhale 1997 erythromycin a gastric prokinetic agent demonstrated a 75 success rate in one openlabel study vanderhoof 1993when both prophylactic and abortive therapy fail supportive care  becomes an essential aspect of treatment during acute episodes intravenous glucosecontaining fluids may diminish the severity of episodes by up to 42 li int semin pediatr gastroenterol nutr 2000 glucose may be the active ingredient by truncating the ketosis however the abdominal pain may be severe enough to require nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs nsaids or narcotics once a surgical abdomen has been excluded sedatives such as diphenhydramine lorazepam and chlorpromazine have been administered to permit sleep and to provide temporary respite from unrelenting nausea li int semin pediatr gastroenterol nutr 2000 the combined use of lorazepam and ondansetron appears to be more effective than ondansetron alonemost published series indicate that cyclic vomiting syndrome cvs lasts an average of 2555 years resolving in late childhood or early adolescence a few patients continue to be symptomatic through adulthoodas early as 1898 clinicians observed that some patients went on to develop migraine headaches the fact that some children with cvs progress to abdominal migraines and then to migraine headaches implies that a sequential progression of agedependent manifestations of migraines may exista survey by abuarafeh and colleagues 1995 revealed the mean ages of children with cvs abdominal migraines and migraine headaches to be 53 103 and 115 years respectively this supports the developmental progression from vomiting to abdominal pain to headachein unpublished data li and hayes found that nearly one third of patients develop migraines after resolution of cvs and predict that nearly 75 develop migraines by age 18 years li and hayes 1999caption   picture 1 cyclic versus chronic temporal patterns of recurrent vomiting the number of emeses is plotted over a 2month period the chronic pattern represented by a thin dashed line has low grade on nearly a daily basis eg gastroesophageal reflux the cyclic pattern represented by a heavy solid line involves highintensity episodes intermittently once every several weeks eg cyclic vomiting syndromebackground acute diarrhea is defined as the abrupt onset of abnormally high fluid content in the stool more than the normal value of approximately 10 mlkgd this situation usually implies an increased frequency of bowel movements which can range from 45 to more than 20 times per day the augmented water content in the stools is due to an imbalance in the physiology of the small and large intestinal processes involved in the absorption of ions organic substrates and water a common disorder in its acute form diarrhea has many causes and may be mild to severe childhood acute diarrhea is usually caused by infection however a number of disorders may cause this condition including a malabsorption syndrome and various enteropathies acuteonset diarrhea is usually selflimited however an acute infection can have a protracted course by far the most common complication of acute diarrhea is dehydrationpathophysiology viruses directly damage the small intestinal villi thereby decreasing intestinal surface area and unmasking ongoing fluid secretion by enteric crypts furthermore rotavirus produces an enterotoxin that possibly induces secretion and contributes to the watery diarrhea bacteria may cause diarrhea by several different mechanisms invasive bacteria cause mucosal ulceration and abscess formation with a concomitant inflammatory response bacterial toxins may influence  enteral and extraenteric cellular processes for example the heatlabile and heatstable enterotoxins of escherichia coli  activate enteral adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase respectively verotoxin which is

carry off the eighth part of the human race why since all time have bladders been subject to being stone quarries why the plague war famine the inquisition turn in every direction you will find no other solution than that everything has been necessaryi speak here to philosophers only and not to theologians we know well that faith is the thread in the labyrinth we know that the fall of adam and eve original sin the immense power given to the devil the predilection accorded by the great being to the jewish people and the baptism substituted for the amputation of the prepuce are the answers which explain everythingwe do not know any religion without prayers even the jews had some although there was not among them any public form until the time when they sang canticles in their synagogues which happened very latesome philosophers more respectful to the supreme being and less condescending to human frailty for all prayer desired only resignation it is indeed what seems proper as between creature and creator but philosophy is not made to govern the world she rises above the common herd she speaks a language that the crowd cannot understand it would be suggesting to fishwives that they should study conic sectionsthe eternal has his intentions from all eternity if prayer accords with his immutable wishes it is quite useless to ask of him what he has resolved to do if one prays him to do the contrary of what he has resolved it is praying him to be weak frivolous inconstant it is believing that he is thus it is to mock him either you ask him a just thing in this case he must do it and the thing will be done without your praying him for it entreating him is even to distrust him or the thing is unjust and then you outrage him you are worthy or unworthy of the grace you implore  if worthy he knows it better than you if unworthy you commit a crime the more in asking for what you do not deservei have spent nearly forty years of my pilgrimage in two or three corners of this world seeking the philosophers stone that is called truth i have consulted all the adepts of antiquity epicurus and augustine plato and malebranch and i have remained in my poverty maybe in all these philosophers crucibles there are one or two ounces of gold but all the rest is residue dull mud from which nothing can be borndoes this being who possesses intelligence and power in so high a degree exist necessarily it must be so for either the being received existence from another or from its own nature if the being received existence from another which is very difficult to imagine i must have recourse to this other and this other will be the prime author to whichever side i turn i have to admit a prime author potent and intelligent who is such necessarily by his own naturedid this prime author produce things out of nothing that is not imaginable to create out of nothing is to change nothing into something i must not admit such a production unless i find invincible reasons which force me to admit what my intelligence can never comprehendall that exists appears to exist necessarily since it exists for if today there is a reason for the existence of things there was one yesterday there was one in all time and this cause must always have had its effect without which it would have been during eternity a useless causebut how shall things have always existed being visibly under the hand of the prime author this power therefore must always have acted in the same way nearly that there is no sun without light so there is no movement without a being that passes from one point of space to another pointif matter is eternally necessary it is therefore impossible it is therefore contradictory that it does not exist but what man can affirm that it is impossible that it is contradictory that this pebble and this fly have not existence one is nevertheless forced to suppress this difficulty which astonishes the imagination more than it contradicts the principles of reasoningin fact as soon as you have imagined that everything has emanated from the supreme and intelligent being that nothing has emanated from the being without reason that this being existing always must always have acted that consequently all things must have eternally issued from the womb of his existence you should no more refuse to believe in the matter of which this pebble and this fly an eternal production are formed than you refuse to imagine light as an eternal emanation from the omnipotent beingsince i am a being with extension and thought my extension and my thought are therefore necessary productions of this being it is evident to me that i cannot give myself either extension or thought i have therefore received both from this necessary beingto say that this eternal being this omnipotent god has from all time necessarily filled the universe with his productions is not to deprive him of his liberty on the contrary for liberty is only the power of actingthe liberty that is called liberty of indifference is a phrase without idea an absurdity for it would be determination without reason it would be an effect without a cause therefore god cannot have this socalled liberty which is a contradiction in terms he has therefore always acted through this same necessity which makes his existencethese preliminary assertions are the basis of the ancient oriental philosophy and of that of the greeks one must except democritus and epicurus whose corpuscular philosophy combated these dogmas but let us remark that the epicureans relied on an entirely erroneous natural philosophy and that the metaphysical system of all the other philosophers holds good with all the systems of natural philosophy the whole of nature excepting the vacuum contradicts epicurus and no phenomenon contradicts the philosophy which i have just explained weli is not a philosophy which is in accord with all that passes in nature and which contents the most careful minds superior to all other nonrevealed systemsafter the assertions of the ancient philosophers which i have reconciled as far as has been possible for me what is left to us a chaos of doubts and chimeras i do not think that there has ever been a philosopher with a system who did not at the end of his life avow that he had wasted his time it must be admitted that the inventors of the mechanical arts have been much more useful to mankind than the inventors of syllogisms  the man who invented the shuttle surpasses with a vengeance the man who imagined innate ideasa mother does not love her son because she

beastbut it is through prejudice that you will respect a man clad in certain clothes walking gravely speaking likewise your parents have told you that you should bow before this man you respect him
